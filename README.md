# Mesh Analysis Overlay

> ## Performance Note
> Since the analysis can be a heavy process, it does not recalculate on every frame.
>
> Cached data per object allows for editing the mesh in object or edit mode with no problems.
>
> **Refresh the overlay by toggling it off and on while in Object Mode**.
