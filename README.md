# Mesh Analysis Overlay

> ## Performance Note
> Since the analysis can be a heavy process, it does not recalculate on every frame.
>
> Cached data per object allows editing the mesh in object/edit mode with no problems.
>
> **The overlay will be refreshed by disabling and re-enabling it or toggling EDIT mode on/off.**.
